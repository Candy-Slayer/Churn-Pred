# üß† Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds an end-to-end **machine learning pipeline** to predict **customer churn** using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**.  
The goal is to identify customers likely to discontinue their service.

## üìä Project OverView
- Explored and cleaned telecom customer data.
- Applied **data preprocessing**, **feature encoding**, and **scaling**.
- Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE** and **Tomek links**.
- Trained models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Applied **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and performance comparison.
- Evaluated using **cross-validation** and **recall metrics**.
- Built a local **Streamlit app** for interactive, real-time predictions.
